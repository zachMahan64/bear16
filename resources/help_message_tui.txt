                                               THANK YOU FOR USING BEAR16
========================================================================================================================
WHAT TO DO IN THE BEAR16 TERMINAL USER INTERFACE
------------------------------------------------
- You can use the assembler and emulator to run:
    - Standalone programs
    - Apps for the Bear16 OS
    - Write your own OS for the system (you could reuse my OS Core libraries to streamline the process!)

MAKING A NEW PROJECT
--------------------
    1.) Create a new directory inside `projects_b16` or another location if you prefer and set it as your open project
    2.) Create at least one `.asm` file to be used as your entry point and set it as such in the project config.
    3.) You can create and link as many `.asm` files as you want (use the` @include` directive; see README for details).
    4.) Make sure to follow the opcode syntax in the ISA spreadsheet and the directive syntax section in the README.
    5.) The assembler is pretty helpful with any kind of syntax mistake, but it cannot catch logical errors.
